         <p>What do you hope to learn in your CSS course?</p>
         <p>I think I would like to just learn more about all the different things you can change within CSS to change the way a web page can look.</p>
         <p>During the html class, I thought that CSS was cool but I didn't really know exactly how to do everything in it, and I thought that my web pages could've been a lot better.</p>
