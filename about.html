         <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Picture of Me" height="300"> <!-- Image of me and my brother at a Dodger game in 2010-->
         <p>My name is Manuel Ricardo Aguilar, and I am a 17 year old firt year college student at Lemoore College.</p>
         <p>Some hobbies of mine are watching sports and playing video games. My favorite sports are Baseball, Basketball, and Football. My teams for those sports are the Dodgers, Lakers, and Rams.</p>
         <p>I don't play a lot of different types of video games, I'm pretty simple when it comes to the games that I play. I normally will play NBA 2K, Madden, or MLB The Show, Sometimes I may play some other games on my PC but I usually just play the sports games.</p>
